# chatgpt4productivitydemo
We test the impact of chatGPT using GPT-4 on productivity and speed of development. Read the transcription.txt to see how it is performed.

We will use ChatGPT to talk to, and copy the code it generates. We will guide it through our ideas and see how far we can go before talking to it becomes more work than doing it ourselves. GPT3 was great for boilerplate, but would lose threads rather soon and start making up procedures that were never defined, etc.

Full chat transcript is in the repository.

Initial commit is after a couple of hours of work, it still keeps the thread, but occasionally it forgets variable or function names. Nothing a developer can't spot and manually fix.

This is not a "ChatGPT" does everything project, instead we observe the impact on productivity, a sort of real world use case.

Some design ideas are intentional, for example, using 2d URP template, because I expect most tutorials to be on a basic render, and we can spot how often ChatGPT forgets this fact.
Every time I refactor something, I will let it know, and we can see how often it forgets we refactored something.
